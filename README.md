The Book Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline book inventory management for libraries or personal collections. Built using 
Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and Bootstrap 5, the system allows users to perform essential operations such as adding, editing, viewing, and deleting books efficiently. 
The application features a user-friendly and responsive interface, ensuring seamless accessibility across different devices. Users can add new books by providing 
details, while existing records can be updated or removed with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions. The system dynamically renders book data 
using Thymeleaf, integrating seamlessly with a Oracle database for data persistence. The project follows a structured workflow where books are displayed in a 
tabular format, and if no records exist, a message indicating 'No Records Found' is shown. With its clean UI, robust backend, and interactive functionalities, 
this Book Management System enhances efficiency, making book organization and tracking effortless.
